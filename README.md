# Assessment 3: Web Prototype
#### __UNIKEY: JKIM5387__    
  
### Aim of StudBud
This prototype of StudBud aims to provide students, primarily visual learners to access the materials and tools that will assist them in planning and performing study. In a study by Felder and Silverman (1988), "most college" teaching presents  information "predominantly auditory (lecturing) or a visual representation of auditory information". 
 StudBud aims to yield the effectiveness and popularity of visual teaching through its user interface design and embedded tools.

 ### Feedback from the Design Pitch
 My feedback for the design pitch can be summarised in these statements:
 
 - There was a misunderstanding of the design brief - in that my initial target audience of students struggling with managing a healthy work-life balance was not specific enough
 - Functionality of the website was not clear
 - Research did not align with StudBud's purpose as a study management tool

 Thus, in this prototype, I started afresh and went in an entirely different direction. In targetting visual learners, I could purposefully choose the different tools that would be catered towards them. 

 ### Rationale for the chosen tools
 #### **Kanban Board**
 Kanban boards is a tool that "help(s) visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow)" according to Atlassian (2019). With visual learners as the main target audience, this prototype of StudBud has included a kanban board which students can use to visualise each task and grasp what tasks need to be completed to finish a project.
 
 #### **Reading List**
 The reading list creator is similar to the Kanban board, in  that it allows students to organise each of their readings into designated categories or groups. As a result, students are provided with diagrams where they can organise each of their readings into a group, for example, for a specific assessment or subject. This is useful for visual learners as diagrams can aid in "comprehension" which further supports the "effectiveness of visual learning" as Butcher (2006) states in a study.

#### **Pomodoro Timer**
Pomodoro timers "breaks down a task into smaller chunks" and thus avoid burn-out when studying too much, which Costales et al.(2021) confirms in his paper about the effectiveness of the Pomodoro technique in the face of online learning. When students are spending more hours at their workspace, it is quite difficult detaching oneself from their work. Thus, I decided to include the Pomodoro timer to provide students with a more balanced and efficient method of studying, regardless if they are visual learners or not. Furthermore, Pomodoro timers often give students a sense of affirmation and accomplishment when viewing the amount of 25 min sessions that they have completed.



Initially, I intended for the Pomodoro Timer to include a visual mode in which they can see how many cycles of study (or 25 minute sessions) they have accomplished. In a style similar to Forest, an application that uses the visual medium of a tree growing everytime a study enters a study session, I wanted to use the medium of a Pomodoro tomato growing to encapsulate a sense of accomplishment within the user. However, I found that I did not have the resources and time to accomplish this.

 ### For Next Time...
With further iteration, feedback and prototyping, StudBud will be an extremely effective tool for visual learners to use when managing and undertaking study sessions through its various features such as the Pomodoro timer, Kanban Board and reading list creator. Several features that I would like to enhance and iterate upon would be:

- Adding playlists for the music player, which the user can select their own music to listen to
- Adding more features to the Pomodoro timer such as adding a visual method in which students can view how many cycles they have completed.
- Adding a customisable timer within the Pomodoro timer
- Adding further options to be displayed in each task container for the Kanban board, including priority ratings with designated colours and due dates.
